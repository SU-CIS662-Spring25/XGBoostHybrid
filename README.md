### Project Requirements:

* "our only requirement is that it **not be based on neural networks or deep learning**. Any approach using regression or classification that we did in class, as well as any statistical analysis including time series would be reasonable choices."  

* Report: "Your report must be well written so that you can use it to show what you did for the class, say to a prospective employer. You must **explain in some detail so we can understand what you did without looking into the code**. Also, you must **cite sources of data** and make references to any information you used (such as journal articles). Even though each team member submits a separate report, the reports for students in a team can be identical."  

* Grading: "**Grading will be based on the creativity used in the approach taken and the justification provided in the report**. Individual grades will depend on level of participation in the team. Any obvious errors in terms of the code will be penalized. While it is important to get accurate predictions, that will not be the main focus."  

### Deliverables:
~~* April 8: initial predictions for April 8-11 in CSV file~~

* April 22: final predictions for April 22-25 as CSV file 

* May 1: final predictions along with actual prices, project report PDF, Jupyter notebook output as PDF
